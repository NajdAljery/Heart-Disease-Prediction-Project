# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## 📋 Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data using machine learning. The dataset includes various medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more. A Random Forest model was trained and evaluated to classify patients as having heart disease or not.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn)
- Power BI (for interactive dashboard)
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for data visualization)

## 📂 Project Structure
- `heart_data_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- `heart_model_script.py` - Python script to train and evaluate the model
- `HeartDiseaseDashboard.pbix` - Power BI dashboard file showing interactive visualizations and prediction summaries
- `/images` - Folder containing plots and relevant images
- `dashboard_preview.mp4` - Optional video preview of the Power BI dashboard

## 🔍 Key Features
- Data preprocessing and encoding categorical variables
- Model training with Random Forest classifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix
- Interactive Power BI dashboard displaying:
  - Patient statistics
  - Disease prediction results
  - Filters by age, gender, and heart disease status

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `heart_model_script.py` in Python environment
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
3. Run the script to train the model and output evaluation metrics
4. Open `HeartDiseaseDashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard
